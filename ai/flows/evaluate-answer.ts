    Consider the following:
    - Did the candidate answer the question directly?
    - Did the candidate provide sufficient detail?
    - Did the candidate use specific examples to support their answer?
    - How does the answer relate to the information provided in their resume?

    Provide a textual evaluation of the answer.
    Also, provide a numerical score from 0 to 10 for the answer, where 0 is poor and 10 is excellent.
    Describe the key elements or points you were expecting in an ideal answer for this specific question.
    Suggest 1-2 relevant online resources (e.g., articles, documentation links) that would help the candidate deepen their understanding of the question's topic. For each resource, provide a title and a URL.

    In addition to your evaluation, score, expected answer elements, and suggested resources, use the followUpQuestionSuggestion tool to suggest ONE follow-up question that would help you better assess the candidate's skills and experience. The tool's description is: Suggests a relevant follow-up question based on the answer and the resume.

    Return the evaluation, the score, the expected answer elements, the suggested resources, and the follow up question.
